** How to startup wasm

In your project:

~$ rustup target install wasm32-unknown-unknown~

*wasm-server-runner*

~cargo install wasm-server-runner~

On ~.cargo/contig.toml~ (in your project folder, or globally in your user home folder):

WARN: Not ~Cargo.toml~ !!

#+begin_src toml
[target.wasm32-unknown-unknown]
runner = "wasm-server-runner"
#+end_src

Run game with:
~cargo run --target wasm32-unknown-unknown~

** cargo-watch

Install:

~cargo install cargo-watch~

With it, you can detect changes in the project directory, and automatically rebuild and relaunch the server:

~cargo watch -cx "run --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown"~
