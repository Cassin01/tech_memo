** What I learned.

Async closure are unstable.

- issue #62290 <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/62290> for more information to use an async block :NOTE:

So I think Rust can't gen handler with lambda function.

** How to startup wasm

In your project:
~$ rustup target install wasm32-unknown-unknown~

*wasm-server-runner*
~cargo install wasm-server-runner~

On ~.cargo/contig.toml~ (in your project folder, or globally in your user home folder):

WARN: Not ~Cargo.toml~ !!

#+begin_src toml
[target.wasm32-unknown-unknown]
runner = "wasm-server-runner"
#+end_src

Run game with:
~cargo run --target wasm32-unknown-unknown~
