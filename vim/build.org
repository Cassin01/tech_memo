* How to build neovim

```build-nvim.sh
#!/bin/sh -eu
cd /usr/local/src
brew reinstall ninja libtool automake cmake pkg-config gettext curl
sudo git clone https://github.com/neovim/neovim
cd neovim
sudo make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
git checkout stable # If you want the stable release
sudo make install
```

* E886: System error while opening ShaDa file ~/Users/foo/.local/share/nvim/shada/main.shada~ for reading: permission denied

After I built nvim, this warning occur.

The reason for this warning may be I was built with sudo.

#+begin_src sh
$ sudo make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
#+end_src

I found the folder ~nvim~ 's owner was root.

#+begin_src sh
$ pwd
/Users/foo/.local/state
$ ls -l
drwx------  4 root staff  128  5 24 15:45 nvim
#+end_src

So I changed owner by the bellow command.

#+begin_src sh
$ sudo chown foo nvim
#+end_src

This worked well.
